Song Description - 

	"Kolaveri Di" is a popular song composed and sung 
by an Indian singer and actor Dhanush. The song was composed for the 
Tamil film "3" and became a viral sensation on the internet for its 
"Tanglish" (Tamil and English) lyrics. The song's lyrics, written in broken
English, have been widely praised for their humor and relatability amongst
young generation. Despite its simple melody and seemingly random
words, "Kolaveri Di" has been embraced by audiences
of all ages and has become a beloved classic in Indian pop culture. 

	While brain storming for this song Dhanush completed the lyrics in
20 minutes. The first line he sang was "Why This Kolaveri?" which means
"Why do you have this murderous rage against me girl?". The question, 
however, is not intended seriously.
	
	This song is also called a 'Soup' song, where 'Soup' (as in 'crying') is a colloquial Tamil
word which refers to young men experiencing depression
after love failure in a love relationship.
